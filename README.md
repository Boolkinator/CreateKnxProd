# CreateKnxProd
Simple Gui to create simple knxprod file for ETS. 

Configuration:
Change the path in App.Config to your ETS4 Path. If you have ETS5 use the path to the ETS4 dlls of ETS5. For example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\ETS5\CV\4.0.1997.50261

If ETS doesn't import the generated file, try removing underscores from product name, hardware name etc. Maybe version numbers have to be at least 10 too.
